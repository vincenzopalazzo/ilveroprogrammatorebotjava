# Il vero programmatore bot 

This bot is a bot for telegrams and is meant to be a collection of phrases/images for programmers, like a spacobot but for programmers.

## Getting Started

To start using my bot just go to the telegram and look for the @ilVeroProgrammatore_bot bot.
Instead if you want to use my architecture to create your bot you must know that I use the following frameworks

The loggin system was initially SLF4J with logback but with bugs introduced and not found yet during development, we opted to use log4j, the configuration file and log4j.properties passed as command line information to the main and therefore customizable as you want [il vero programmatore](http://xmau.com/humour/veroprogrammatore.html) I'll place mine

### Installing

To launch the application by activating the log system, tear the following commandm

```
java -jar app-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar /position/file/onDirectory/log4j.properties
```
